Git and GitHub


Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codes.It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, making it easier to manage and merge changes.


GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. 




1.Concepts of Git explaining various terms. 


* Repository
            A repository or ‘repo’ is a place where we can store our codes, files and file history.
            It is the  most  basic element of GitHub and it can be either local or remote.


* Commit
            It is used to record changes in the repository.
     
* Cloning
            Cloning means we are making a copy of the repository in our system.


* Forking
            Forking means creating a copy of our repository which allows us to make independent
            changes without affecting the original repository. 


* Branch
            Branch is a separate version of our repository. It allows us to work on the different
            versions of our repository at the same time. 


* Merge
            It allows us to combine the changes from different branches into a single branch. 


* Pull Request
            It lets us tell others about the changes we have pushed to a branch in a repository.


















2.  Basic commands of git.


* git config -This command helps us to configure variables that control various aspects on how git looks and operates. 


* git init - It is used to initialize a new git repository.


* git clone - It is used to download an existing git repository on our local computer 


* git add - It allows us to add all the local changes of our working copy to the   staging area(index) so that those changes can be committed to our local repository.


*  git commit - It records changes to the repository.


* Git log - For viewing commit history.


*  git branch - It allows us to determine what branch the local repository is on.


*  git checkout - For switching branch.


*  git push - It is used to push the contents from a local repository to a remote repository.


*  git pull - It is used to incorporate new changes from the remote repository.


*  git merge - It is used to combine changes from different branches into a single branch. 


     


















3.  Concepts




GitHub
It is a web-based platform for version control using Git. It provides a collaborative environment for software developers to host and review codes, manage projects and facilitate team collaboration. It is widely used  for both open source and collaborative projects.




GitLab
It is a web-based git repository that provides free, open and private repositories. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all tasks in a project from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security.




BitBucket
It is the repository management tool that is specially built for expert teams and professionals. It is also called as Git repository management software and is a central hub for handling all the git repositories. It allows users to do basic git operations such as reviewing or merging code. It is focused on private repositories while GitHub is a better fit for public repositories.  








4.Industrial practices of using Git


* Version Control - Git is primarily used for version control, enabling teams to track changes made to the source code over time. 


* Write descriptive commit messages


* Collaborative Development - Git facilitates collaboration among developers, allowing them to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.


* Identify a branching strategy.




5.Cloning a repository to local 


To clone a Git repository onto your local machine, begin by copying the repository URL from GitHub. Open a terminal window and navigate to the destination directory where you intend to store the local copy. Initiate the cloning process using the `git clone’ command followed by the repository URL. Upon completion of the cloning process, you will have successfully obtained a local copy of the repository within the specified directory.
